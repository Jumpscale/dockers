## gitbook documentation build for all jumpscale/gig/... components

- allow everyone to build all our docs starting from source code
    - raml files
    - jumpscale internal interfaces (docgenerator)
    - doc directories in code repo's
- could be that not every user who uses this tool has all rights, but that is ok, script should ignore where user has no rights
